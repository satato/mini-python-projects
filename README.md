# Python Mini-Projects

### What is this?
This repository serves as a collection of mini-projects, done and detailed in Python, the instructions of which come from online, old university computer science exams which are intended to be used as study materials, as well as simple projects that I have assigned to students I instructed at CS summer camps.

The implementation of each mini-project is my own, built to the specifications that I have provided as a .md file for each.
